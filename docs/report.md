## Abstract
With an Internet of Things (IoT) spatially distributed in our environment, users often feel a need to interact with them more efficiently. We summarize a design space of interaction with different deivce and identify an underexplored area that inspires the design of DDIoTA--- a front end “digital assistant” system that listens to user commands and coordinates distributed applications spanning multiple devices including sensors/actuators. We collected some real world commands that are largely used in daily lives and used multiple models such as Bert[1], Flair[2] and NTLK[3] to process the command. In this report, we first introduce the background, goals and related works of this project, then we provide system design and technical approaches on how the command is processed. At last, we organize the potential future works and conclusion for this project.


## Introduction
  ### Background & Goals
  A large number of spatially-distributed Internet of Things (IoT) has populated our living and work environments, motivating researchers to explore various interaction techniques. At present, the main interaction method with a majority of IoT assistants such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Apple Siri is through voice command. However, these interaction techniques are limited to a single command over a static device rather than a dynamic distribution on multiple devices. This brings plenty of inefficiency to the interaction scenario, as when a user attempts to make commands over a wide range of devices, there is no way for him to simply conduct a one-time command. Instead, he'd have to input those commands one at a time depending on the number of device. 
  
  To solve this inefficient scenario, we present DDIoTA, an IoT assistant that could achieve macroprogramming over a dynamic set of devices. This project is based on some state-of-the-art models and neural networks. There are three major steps of this project:
